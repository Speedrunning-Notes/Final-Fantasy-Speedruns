\chapter{S.S. Winno, ya?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \cs[1:10], ya? Then exit on the right, Brudda. Gotta see Oaka, maybe he's got some good deals, ya? Then run outside to the top deck for a cutscene with me and Lulu, ya?
    \item Gotta run up to the blitzball at the front of the boat, ya? Cutscene's another ten minutes, so get comfy, ya?
    \item Just gotta follow the tutorial, ya? But no can do, gotta fail the minigame, ya? Don't get that Jecht Shot, ya hear? It's a waste of time, like those Al Bhed machina!
    \item Save data's on Yuna's scene, ya? But no saving this time, ya? There's a skippable movie, but it's only thirty seconds if ya buffered the start command back in Kilika, ya know? It's like setting up a good blitzball play.
