\author{Wakka and all da Blitzball Fans, Brudda!}

Welcome to the Final Fantasy X Any\% Speedrun Notes. These notes are da best, ya? We gonna beat Sin FAST!
\bothnewline
These notes are da work of a lotta real amazing folks who helped me put everyting in one place. Thanks, ya?

Some beginning info about da run, ya:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ya should be able to finish ya first run, if ya listen up good. Follow da notes, ya? Mess 'em up, and ya runs gonna be kaput. No can do somethin' different 'cause ya think it'll work, unless ya tried it, ya? Like, don't use Marbles on Biran and Yenke instead of Gems. Marbles kill, but no overkill, so no drops. Ya know? Why we do dese tings ain't in da notes. No need for dat, brudda. If ya wanna read more, check out \link{https://grayfox96.github.io/FFX-Info/}{dis site by Grayfox} or join us in da \link{https://discord.gg/X3qXHWG}{Discord}. We don't bite, ya?
    \item Common mistakes? Grid mistakes, ya. Some ya can't fix. It's bad news, it happens. Learn for next time, and double check ya grids.
    \item Dis run is LONG. Make sure ya got all ya stuff. Ya want a shorter run? Use da Cutscene Remover Mod, dat's its own game. But dese notes still work, ya.
    \item Blitzball stinks! If ya lose, it's da pits. But ya can still beat da game, just lose 1-2 minutes. No worries, brudda. Just like when da Aurochs lose, ya keep goin'!
    \item \textbf{Learn how to do MRR Skip First}, ya? These notes need ya to nail dat skip. No failin'! Ya can find a video \link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSnxE6Xzvkk}{here}. Practice saves? In da \link{https://discord.gg/X3qXHWG}{Discord}, brudda.
    \item Dese notes? No RNG manip! Actions change based on da seed. No need to worry 'bout dat when ya start. When ya get da hang of it, ask in da \link{https://discord.gg/X3qXHWG}{Discord}.
    \item Have fun, brudda! Time for some blitzball action!
\end{itemize}

Some info 'bout how dese notes are, ya know, laid out:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Got some acronyms in da run, ya?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \sd: \textbf{Skip Dialogue}. In cutscenes, ya can skip some stuff. When da words show up, hit \textbf{Confirm} quick to make 'em go away. Dat stops da voices, makes da scene go faster. Mash dat button, ya?
        \item \cs: \textbf{Cutscene}. Game cutscene, ya? No can do nothin'. Take a break. Got da time for PS2, so ya can plan ya breaks.
        \item \fmv: \text{Full Motion Video}. Pre-made cutscene, ya? Can't do nothin' 'bout it (mostly), take a break. Times for PS2, so plan ahead.
        \item \skippablefmv: \textbf{Skippable Full Motion Video}. Pre-made, but ya can skip on PC. Still got times, 'cause no skip on PS2, ya know?
        \item \save: Touch Save Spheres, full heal! Touch it, then back out, ya?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Read each page, like dis: Left side, den right side, den da next page. Got some boxes dat take up both sides. Do da stuff above da box first (left, den right), den da stuff below da box da same way (left, den right).
    \item Each bullet is its own ting. Do what it says, den go to da next one, ya?
    \item Sometimes ya gotta get an item, or overdrive, ya? Before movin' on. If da notes say so... \textbf{Do It}! No backup plans here, brudda. We trust in Yevon, ya?
\end{itemize}

Some info 'bout Spheres, ya?:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Da Sphere Grid needs 45 Power Spheres. Ya get 37 for sure in da run. So ya need 8 extra, ya know? Gotta keep track of da extras, so ya know if ya low and need da backup plans. Da for-sure Power Spheres are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tros - 2
        \item Besaid Dingos - 2
        \item Besaid Garuda - 1
        \item Geneaux - 4
        \item Sahagins - 17
        \item Vouivre + Garuda - 2
        \item Raldo - 1
        \item Wendigo - 2
        \item Bombs - 6
    \end{itemize}
    \item Da Sphere Grid needs 17 Speed Spheres. Don't matter when ya get 'em, but keep track of all da drops. Got backup plans for Speed Spheres later in da run, ya?
    \ifthenelse{\equal{\blitzresult}{win}}{%
        \item Dese are da \blitzwin\ notes, ya? Strategy is based on winnin' Blitzball, like da Besaid Aurochs always do! If ya lose, switch to da \blitzloss\ notes, ya?
    }{\ifthenelse{\equal{\blitzresult}{both}}{%
        \item Dese notes got both da \blitzwin\ and \blitzloss\ plans. Gotta change da strategy based on if ya win or lose at Blitzball, ya?
    }{%
        \item Dese are da \blitzloss\ notes, ya? Da plan is based on losin' at Blitzball. If ya win, switch to da \blitzwin\ notes, ya?
    }}
\end{itemize}
